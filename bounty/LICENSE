BOUNTY LICENSE
==============

BOUNTY is built on top of CBMC.
BOUNTY consists of the following tools:-
1. "bracer": adds braces around C statements
2. "instrumenter": instruments the C code with assertions for non-termination checking using CBMC 
3. CBMC --- the C Bounded Model checker, available at https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc
4. Z3 : the Z3 SMT solver available at https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3
5. Glucose : the Glucose SAT solver available at https://github.com/audemard/glucose
6. bounty.sh: a shell script that all glues all the above for non-termination checking.

Of the above, 1 , 2, and 6 are our contributions, and we use MIT license for them just like CBMC. The other tools (CBMC, Z3 and Glucose) are bound by their respective licenses.
